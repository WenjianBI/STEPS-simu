# STEPS-simu
Codes to run simulations in STEPS manuscript

### STEPS-example.R
An R file including codes to
* install STEPS package
* read in a sub-function for simulations given n.rep (number of replications) and random.seed
* set working direcotry
* output results with given parameter settings for both continuous and binary secondary traits

### out-steps-continuous.csv
An example CSV file for simulation results generated by STEPS-example.R with continuous secodnary trait 

### out-steps-binary.csv
